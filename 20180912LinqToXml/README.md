# Laboratory task

The goal is to practice Linq to Xml expressions.
Tasks to solve are in TasksToComplete.cs as unit tests.
During the development, try to avoid code duplications as much as possible.
Use additional unit tests to apply TDD in your work!

The unit tests checking your solution are targeting the XML (SVG) file rectangles.svg.
You can have a look at the contents of the image in rectangles.png.
